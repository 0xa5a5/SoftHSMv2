SoftHSM develop

* SOFTHSM-68: Display a better configure message when there is a 
  version of Botan with a broken ECC/GOST/OID implementation.
* SOFTHSM-70: Improved handling of the database backend.
* SOFTHSM-71: Supporting Botan 1.11.
* SOFTHSM-76: Do not generate RSA keys smaller than 1024 bit when 
  using the Botan crypto backend.
* SOFTHSM-83: Support CKA_VALUE_BITS for CKK_DH private key object.
* SOFTHSM-89: Use constants and not strings for signaling algorithms.
* SUPPORT-129: Possible to use an empty template in C_GenerateKey.
  The class and key type are inherited from the generation mechanism.
  Some mechanisms do however require a length attribute. [SOFTHSM-88]
* SUPPORT-131: Support RSA-PSS using SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384,
  or SHA512. [SOFTHSM-87]

Bugfixes:
* SOFTHSM-69: GOST did not work when you disabled ECC.
* SOFTHSM-78: Correct the attribute checks for a number of objects.
* Fixed a number of memory leaks.
* SOFTHSM-80: Prevent segfault in OpenSSL GOST HMAC code.


SoftHSM 2.0.0a1 - 2014-02-10

This is the first alpha release of SoftHSMv2. It focuses on a higher 
level of security by encrypting sensitive information and using 
unswappable memory. There is also a more generalized crypto backend,
where you can use Botan or OpenSSL.
